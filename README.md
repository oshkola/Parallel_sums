## Parallel_sums

Solution to the technical task.

Take the integer array with the even number of elements. Split the array
in two equal parts in suvh a way, that all elements of subarrays add up to the equal number.
Return -1 if that's inpossible.
If that's possible, return the string representation of the first array followed by the second one with
each integer separated by comma and both arrays sorted in ascending order. The set that goes first is the one with the 
smallest first element.
